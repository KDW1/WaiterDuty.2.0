### The Reason behind it all:
#### At my old school, waiter duty was required for each unit (dorm) at least one week every couple weeks. There were three main periods breakfast, lunch (1st, 2nd and 3rd period) and dinners (1st and 2nd Dinner). Signing people up for breakfast and dinner shifts was fairly simple, as there were no limitations there. Whereas for the lunch shifts, a cadet (student) could have one of three lunch periods, for each weekday. Previously, someone would have to sort through this and make a schedule where everyone was doing waiter duty at the correct time in equal amounts, which was pretty tedious, though this web application automates that process.
